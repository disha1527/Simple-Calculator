<h1>Simple Calculator using HTML CSS & JavaScript</h1>

Let’s create a Simple Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project will feature a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

We’ll use HTML to structure the calculator’s interface, CSS to style it for a clean and user-friendly look,
and JavaScript to handle the calculations and user interactions.

<h1>HTML</h1>
The provided code is an HTML document that represents a basic calculator interface.
It consists of a container div that contains an input field and a set of buttons for performing calculations. 
The input field is of type “text” and has a class of “display”. The buttons are divided into two categories: operators and numbers. 
The operator buttons include AC (for clearing the input), DEL (for deleting the last character), % (for calculating percentages), 
and the basic arithmetic operators (/ for division, * for multiplication, – for subtraction, and + for addition). The number buttons range from 0 to 9, including 00 and a decimal point. 
Finally, there is an equal button (=) for evaluating the expression entered in the input field.

<h1>CSS</h1>

The code imports the Google font “Poppins” and sets it as the default font for all elements. 
The body is centered on the page with a background color.
The calculator container has a maximum width, border-radius, and box-shadow. The display and buttons are styled accordingly.

<h1>JavaScript</h1>

The provided JavaScript code snippet is used to create functionality for a calculator.

The code selects the display element and all the buttons on the calculator interface.
It defines a function called “calculate” that performs calculations based on the button clicked.
The function updates the output based on the button value and updates the display accordingly.
Event listeners are added to the buttons, so when clicked, they call the “calculate” function with the corresponding button value.
